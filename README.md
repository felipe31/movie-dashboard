# Movie Dashboard

A frontend dashboard required to be written in Javascript. It contains two views.
The `dashboard` is made of four tables with multiple data from the Golden Raspberry Awards.
The `list` shows a table of all movies in the API provided by _TexoIT_.

## Usage

1. Install project's dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

2. Build the project:

```sh
npm build
```

3. Start the client:

```sh
npm start
```

Or, to enable auto restart:

```sh
npm dev
```

Once the message ` ✓ Ready in XXXms` shows up, the client is ready to be used.

4. Access `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Tests

The client tests if all required components show up in the rendered output.
